#TomsTopsTips Lunchbox Generator
A tool cataloguing the stupid things Tom ([@tomgco](www.twitter.com/tomgco)) comes out with, using the [@TomsTopsTips](www.twitter.com/tomstopstips) Twitter account to pull quotes from and a randomiser written in JavaScript to pick one.

Note I did this in like 20 minutes, I'm aware the code is crap.

##Upcoming Features
*	Pull properly from Twitter - the way I've done this now only pulls the last 3 weeks of tweets because the Twitter API is gay
*	"Share this" and permalinks
*	Who knows, maybe some text will turn green or something again

#Patch Notes
##Version 1.2 (Current Version)
*	Tom didnâ€™t like the green

##Version 1.1
*	Some text is now GREEN!

##Version 1.0
*	Initial release
